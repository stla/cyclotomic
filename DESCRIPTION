Description: The cyclotomic numbers are complex numbers that can be
    thought of as the rational numbers extended with the roots of unity. They
    are represented exactly, enabling exact computations. They contain the
    Gaussian rationals (complex numbers with rational real and imaginary
    part) as well as the square roots of all rational numbers. They also
    contain the sine and cosine of all rational multiples of pi. The
    algorithms implemented in this package are taken from the 'Haskell'
    package 'cyclotomic', whose algorithms are adapted from code by Martin
    Schoenert and Thomas Breuer in the 'GAP' project
    (<https://www.gap-system.org/>).
