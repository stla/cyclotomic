\title{Extract value from a 'Just' value}
\description{
The \code{from_just} function is imported from the 
  \strong{maybe} package.
  Follow the link to its documentation: 
  \code{\link[maybe:from_just]{from_just}}. 
  It has been imported for convenient use of the \code{\link{maybeRational}} 
  function, which possibly returns a 'Just' value.
